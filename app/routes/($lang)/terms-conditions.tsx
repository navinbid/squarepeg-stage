      <br />
      <p>5. Purchasers of Products used with or for Potable Water</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) and regulations
        in CA, LA, MD, and VT prohibit plumbing products (including but not
        limited to pipes, pipe fittings, solder, flux, plumbing fitting, etc.)
        used to convey water for human consumption that are not “lead free” as
        defined by the regulations. In order to determine your particular
        state’s standards applicable to the products you purchase for use in or
        for potable water applications, direct your inquiries to the appropriate
        regulatory agency in your state. In order to determine the federal
        standards applicable to the products you purchase for use in or for
        potable water applications, visit
        http://water.epa.gov/drink/info/lead/index.cfm.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>6. Important Notice to Federal Buyers Re: Country of Origin</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        While products listed on GSA Advantage! meet the requirements of the
        Trade Agreements Act (“TAA”), as implemented by Federal Acquisition
        Regulations Part 25, other products sold by Seller may not meet the
        requirements. At the time of purchase, Seller will advise properly
        identified and authorized schedule Buyers if a product is
        “TAA-compliant.” Any federal Buyer purchasing a non-TAA item will be
        making an “open market” purchase that is not covered by any contract.
        Federal Buyers are advised that the open market purchases are NOT GSA
        schedule purchases. By purchasing any product on the open market, the
        federal Buyer represents that it has authority to make such purchase and
        has complied with all applicable procurement regulations.

        unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalid or

      <br />
      <p>
        Seller’s acceptance of any order is subject to Buyer’s assent to all of
        the terms and conditions set forth herein. Buyer’s assent to these terms
        and conditions shall be presumed from Buyer’s receipt of Seller’s
        acknowledgment, or from Buyer’s acceptance of all or any part of the
        products ordered. No additions or modifications of Seller’s terms and
        conditions by Buyer shall be binding upon Seller, unless agreed to in
        writing by an authorized representative of Seller. If a purchase order
        or other correspondence submitted by Buyer contains terms or conditions
        contrary or in addition to the terms and conditions contained herein or
        in Seller’s acknowledgment, Seller’s fulfillment of any such purchase
        order shall not be construed as assent to any of the terms and
        conditions proposed by Buyer, and will not constitute a waiver by Seller
        of any of the terms and conditions contained herein or in Seller’s
        acknowledgment.Please check these Terms of Use frequently, as we may
        from time to time unilaterally amend the Terms of Use by posting revised
        language on the Website. The most up-to-date version of these Terms of
        Use will always be available for your review on the Website. Amendments
        will become effective at the time they are posted on the Website. Your

        your acceptance of such amendments.

        objection to any terms or conditions additional to or different from
